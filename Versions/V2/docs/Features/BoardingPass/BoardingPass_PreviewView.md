# Preview View

**From version 8 onwards, the preview management changed in the SDK to make it easier to integrate.**

To improve flexibility in the preview screen, the optional preview screen has been removed.

To add a preview feature to your app you can follow the example from our sample app, where we provide an example with the same user interface.
